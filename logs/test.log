Warning:
tensor.grad will return the tensor value of the gradient. This is an incompatible upgrade for tensor.grad API.  It's return type changes from numpy.ndarray in version 2.0 to paddle.Tensor in version 2.1.0.  If you want to get the numpy value of the gradient, you can use :code:`x.grad.numpy()`
